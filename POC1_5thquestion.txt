5.	Find the output and write explanation? 

class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
int t; 
System.out.println("Value of variable t : "+t); 
}
 }

Error: variable t might not have been initialized
Explanation: This error occurs when you are trying to use a local variable without initializing it globally.
 The variable line is not initialized globally before we request to print it.(the error is detected at compile time).
