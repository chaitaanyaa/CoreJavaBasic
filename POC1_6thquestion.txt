6.	Find the output and write explanation? 

class Test { 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
byte b = 127;
 ++b;
 b++;
 System.out.println("Value of variable b : "+b); 
}
}
Output:
Value of variable b : -127

Byte Range is -128 to 127

The variable b is initialized to 127.
But the range of byte in java is :
1 byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
The code increments the value of b by one.
++b pre-increment is used so b = -128, later b++ that is post-increment so b = -128 + 1.
So, b=-127

 So the code prints out "Value of variable b : -127"
